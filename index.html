  <h1>Learn Enough to be dangerous</h1>
  <p>Its Sammy here!</p>
  <p>  Learn Enough to <em>Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement</em> to teach
    technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
    <strong> <em>error messages, and knowing when to just reboot</em></strong> the darn thing.
    We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
    learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
    movement, <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/"> Sign up for our official email list now</a>.</p>

  <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

  <p>  When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
    on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
    interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
    interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.</p>

  <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

  <p>  You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
    Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
    at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
    tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.</p>
